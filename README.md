# CASA0018-Deep-learning-for-sensor-network
The ten week module is roughly split into 2 parts. The first half focuses on introducing the technical skills required to apply Deep Learning on embedded devices. Each lecture will be followed by a hands on, self paced lab session to build a working example of the material taught in the lecture.  The second half continues with lectures but is focused on building a student project. At mid term a project brief will be introduced and this will form the basis for the remaining lab sessions. Weeks 5-10 will include peer feedback via design crits (presentations of work in progress) and some guest lectures covering case studies from field applications.
